# **VarianceIQ – FP&A Variance **

### *COT6930: Generative Intelligence & Software Development Lifecycles – Final Project*

**By: Bhanu Prakash Mudavath**

---

## 📌 **Overview**

**VarianceIQ** is an AI-powered FP&A (Financial Planning & Analysis) assistant designed to automate **Budget vs. Actual variance analysis** using a **multi-agent architecture**.
It combines **deterministic numerical processing** with **generative executive-level narrative explanations**, enabling rapid, data-driven insights for finance teams.

---

## 🚀 **Key Features**

### **1. Analysis Agent (Python – Deterministic Engine)**

Processes the uploaded budget dataset and generates structured quantitative insights:

* Computes absolute & percentage variances
* Applies materiality thresholds
* Detects favorable / unfavorable / neutral drivers
* Aggregates insights by department
* Outputs machine-readable **JSON summary**

---

### **2. Explanation Agent (Azure GPT-4o-mini)**

Transforms numeric output into CFO-style narratives:

* Generates executive summaries
* Highlights top variance drivers
* Writes concise, formal, professional explanations
* Automatic fallback to a **rule-based explainer** when LLM mode is off

---

### **3. Streamlit Interactive Dashboard**

A modern, PowerBI-style interface to explore insights:

* Upload CSV/XLSX budget datasets
* View total budget, expenses, variance KPIs
* Visualize spending and variance using bar & donut charts
* Review generated AI explanations
* Per-user **Run History** with uploaded files & generated narratives
* Login / Signup with persistent user-specific history
